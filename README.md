# Next.js Project Template

This is a customizable [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project template, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and enhanced with additional tools for streamlined development, testing, and deployment.

## Features

This template includes the following features:

- **[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)**: Enables pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks for consistent code quality.
- **Linting**: Ensures consistent coding style across the project with ESLint.
- **Testing**:
  - **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)** and **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: Setup for unit and integration testing.
- **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**: A UI component explorer for creating and documenting isolated components.
- **CI Workflows with GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and linting workflows configured to run on each push and pull request.
- **[Plop](https://plopjs.com/)**: Tool for quickly generating component boilerplate with customizable templates.

## Getting Started

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
